# Introduction 
This is the app I developed by myself during my internship at Fabrit Global in the summer of 2023. 

# Technologies
The app is made with .NET and Angular. The REST API uses Entity Framework Core, mappings, DTOs, async calls and middlewares, while the front-end is based on the Tour of Heroes structure with interceptors added.
